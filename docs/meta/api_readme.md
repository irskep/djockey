This is the API reference documentation for Djockey. To read the primary docs, go to [https://steveasleep.com/djockey/](../plugins/index.html).

The API is unstable and there are _no_ semver guarantees about compatibility at this time. Check back around October, or [open an issue](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues/new) describing your use case.
