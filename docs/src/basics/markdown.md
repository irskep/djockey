# Using Markdown

You can use all standard features of Markdown with Djockey. If you find you can't, [file a bug](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues).

GitHub's markdown is too limited to access most of Djockey's unique features. [In the future](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues/12) you will be able to choose a different Markdown variant.
