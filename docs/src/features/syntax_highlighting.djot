# Syntax highlighting

Djockey supports [all the languages that Shiki supports by default](https://shiki.style/languages), plus Djot.

To highlight a code block, put the language next to the first set of backticks:

````djot
```md
# Some Markdown
```
````

To highlight an inline verbatim expression, add `{.language-foo}`{.language-djot} after your backticks:

```djot
`print("Hello, world")`{.language-python}
```

Output: `print("Hello, world")`{.language-python}
