# Djockey

Djockey is a powerful but experimental static site generator for technical writing and project documentation. The goal is to have the depth and extensibility of [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the ease-of-use and built-in power of [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

- Write [Djot](https://djot.net) or [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- Output HTML or Markdown, so your docs are readable in the GitHub interface or on a nice web site
- Rich cross-references, checked at build time
- Tree-based plugins—stop writing Markdown tokenizer hacks!

## To do

### Documentation

- [x] Why Djockey? Why Djot?
- [ ] Developing/contributing
- [ ] Plugin API docs
- [ ] How to use plugins
- [ ] Config reference
- [ ] How to use custom CSS and JS

### Low-hanging fruit

- [ ] Finish CSS stylesheets
- [ ] Switch from highlight.js to Shiki so we can use [the Djot Textmate grammar](https://github.com/ryanabx/djot-vscode/blob/main/syntaxes/djot.tmLanguage.json)
- [x] Syntax highlighting, Mermaid, Graphviz
- [x] Literal symbol parsing
- [x] Dark mode
- [ ] Multi-tab code blocks/divs
- [ ] Sections with and without self-docs have the same appearance but only one is clickable

### Harder stuff

- [ ] TypeDoc cross-referencing
- [ ] Python autodoc

### Less important but nice

- [ ] Readme-as-output
