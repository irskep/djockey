# Client-side JS

Djockey's built-in client-side JavaScript is written in Typescript under `src/client/js/index.ts`{.language-sh} and compiled with `bun build --target=browser`{.language-sh}. The built JS is committed to git as `templates/html/static/client.js`, in order to avoid Bun as a hard dependency for using Djockey.
