# Getting Started

Once you've [installed Djockey](#installation), create a file called `djockey.yaml`{.language-sh} that looks like this:

```yaml
inputDir: path-to-your-docs
outputDir:
  html: docs_out/html
  gfm: docs_out/gfm
siteName: "Your Name Here"
urlRoot: https://where-docs-will-be-deployed

outputFormats:
  html: true
  gfm: true  # make sure you've installed Pandoc!

html:
  footerText: "Â©2024 You"
```

Now try running `npx djockey`. Maybe it'll just work!
