# Sections

Djockey uses the directory tree to group documents into sections and subsections.

## `index.dj`

Put an `index.dj` (or `index.md`) file in any directory to customize its metadata (`title`, `order`) and give the beginning of the section some content.

If `index.dj` contains front matter but no content, then the section will use the front matter, but no page will be rendered. As an example, see the "Plugins" vs "Writing with Djockey" sections on this site.
