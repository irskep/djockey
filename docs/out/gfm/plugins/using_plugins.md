# Using plugins

Djockey has a plugin API that allows arbitrary transforms on documents.

You can use plugins by specifying a `plugins` array in your
`djockey.config`:

``` yaml
plugins:
- myCustomPlugin.js
- plugin-from-package
```

<div id="Extra-passes" class="section" id="Extra-passes">

## Extra passes

There is a “read” pass and a “write” pass. If a plugin creates new
content that should be processed in turn by other plugins, you can
configure Djockey to run more than one set of passes.

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    Parse(Read documents) --> Read(Read pass)
    Read --> Write(Write pass)
    Write -->|If configured| Read
    Write --> Output
```
