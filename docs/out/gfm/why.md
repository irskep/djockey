## Djot

While Markdown is great, it has some well-documented issues when used
for technical writing. Mainly, it lacks consistent syntax for
extensibility and rich inline metadata. You can read more in these two
blog posts written by maintainers of popular documentation tools:

1.  [Why you shouldn‚Äôt use ‚ÄúMarkdown‚Äù for
    documentation](https://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/),
    by a maintainer of [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.com)
2.  [Beyond Markdown](https://johnmacfarlane.net/beyond-markdown.html),
    by the maintainer of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)

Critically, in order to extend a Markdown parser/renderer, the typical
workflow is to add new syntax using regular expressions, and write a
custom HTML renderer. This means every project potentially has its own
little subset of Markdown for contributors to remember, and can only
ever render to HTML.

Djot is similar to Markdown, and solves the extensibility problem nicely
([1](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jgm/djot/blob/master/doc/syntax.html#inline-attributes),
[2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jgm/djot/blob/master/doc/syntax.html#block-attributes)),
with equivalent tooling written in six programming languages. One syntax
to rule them all! That‚Äôs why Djockey works with Djot data structures
internally.

On the other hand, the reality is that people know Markdown and people
want to write Markdown. Pandoc and the Djot libraries make it trivial to
convert from Markdown to Djot data structures, so Djockey supports
Markdown as well.

### Other options

The [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) flavor of
Markdown uses a very effective approach to bringing the deep
extensibility of
[reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
to Markdown. Unfortunately, the only existing parser is written in
Python, and Djockey is not written in Python. It would be possible to
try supporting MyST down the line by porting MyST‚Äôs markdown-it
extensions to JavaScript.

## Djockey

This is a messy section because I‚Äôm still figuring out what Djockey is.
It is experimental.

There are already several top-tier documentation tools available to you:
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), and
[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev), to name a few. So why consider
Djockey?

I will try to answer the question with a comparison table. I apologize
if I get any details wrong; please [let me
know](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues/new) if I did.

|  | [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) | [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) | [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) | Djockey |
|---:|----|----|----|----|
| **Markup** | md/rst | md | md | md/djot |
| **Extensions** | Tree-based üå≤ | Regex+HTML ü•≤ | Regex+HTML ü•≤ | Tree-based üå≤ |
| **Ecosystem** | Python | Python | JS | JS |
| **Theme** | üòï | ü§© | ü•∞ | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è |
| **Output** | HTML, PDF | HTML | HTML | HTML, Markdown |

For a long time, Sphinx was the gold standard for documentation tools.
It has more powerful cross-referencing and organization features than
anything else. But once people got a taste for Markdown, other tools
with less power but better UX took over. And the JavaScript community
never really touched Sphinx, since it‚Äôs so tied to Python.

Another interesting thing that happened along the way was that people
started expecting to browse docs directly in the GitHub UI.
Markdown-based tools get decent support for free (unless they use
extensions that aren‚Äôt compatible with GitHub, like Material for MkDocs
does). This creates a barrier to the adoption of new markup languages.
If GitHub can‚Äôt display it, people don‚Äôt like it.

With all this in mind, Djockey:

1.  Has the cross-referencing power and extensibility of Sphinx
2.  Renders Markdown specifically for viewing on GitHub
3.  Is written in TypeScript, and in the future will integrate with
    TypeDoc
4.  Hopes to evangelize Djot, but lets you write Markdown

The outcome is that you have an easy time writing your docs, and your
users get the best possible UX.
