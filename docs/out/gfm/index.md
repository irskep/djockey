# Djockey

Djockey is a powerful but experimental static site generator for
technical writing and project documentation. The goal is to have the
depth and extensibility of
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the ease-of-use and
built-in power of [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

- Write [Djot](https://djot.net) or [GitHub Flavored
  Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- Output HTML or Markdown, so your docs are readable in the GitHub
  interface or on a nice web site
- Rich cross-references, checked at build time
- Tree-based pluginsâ€”stop writing Markdown tokenizer hacks!
