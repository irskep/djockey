You can mark some content as applying to a specific version using the
`added-in-version` attribute on an empty div. If you specified a
`projectInfo.version` in your
[configuration](../foundations/configuration.md#config-reference), and
the specified version is greater, then the message will be future-tense.

```
{added-in-version="0.0.1"}
:::
:::

{added-in-version="10.0"}
:::
:::
```

Output:

<div class="version-modified added-in-version">

Added in version 0.0.1

</div>

<div class="version-modified added-in-version">

Will be added in version 10.0

</div>

You can also put content inside if you want to add commentary.

``` djot
