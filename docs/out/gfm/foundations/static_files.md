# Static Files

One design goal of Djockey is to minimize the need to edit a config
file. In this spirit, all files that are not markup (i.e. not Markdown
or Djot) are copied to the output directory.

If you name any files the same as any files in Djockey’s template, your
files will overwrite Djockey’s files. Djockey uses a `dj-` prefix for
all its static files, so you’re unlikely to have a problem with this.

## Automatic handling of CSS, JavaScript, and WOFF2

<div id="CSS" class="section" id="CSS">

### CSS

All static files ending in `.css` are included as
`<link rel="stylesheet">` tags.

If your CSS file ends in `.light.css` or `.dark.css`, it will only be
enabled for light or dark mode, respectively.

If you would like to prevent Djockey from doing this, you can add glob
patterns to the `html.ignore_css` key in `djockey.yaml`. For example,
you would do this if you’re [embedding TypeDoc’s HTML
output](../features/typedoc.md#typedoc-integration) inside your Djockey
docs.

<div id="JavaScript" class="section" id="JavaScript">

### JavaScript

Any CSS and JavaScript files will be included in the HTML output.

</div>

<div id="WOFF2" class="section" id="WOFF2">

### WOFF2

All files ending in `.woff2` will be preloaded in the HTML, to prevent
any flashes of unstyled text before custom CSS loads.

</div>

## Links to static files

If you link to a static file, the link will be verified at build time
and a warning will be printed if no file can be found at the given path.
