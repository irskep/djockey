# Installation

I know I promised you a single-binary distribution, but since I haven’t
actually released Djockey yet, you’ll need to download it.

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:irskep/djockey.git
cd djockey
yarn install
npm link
```

In the future, you’ll be able to run it with `npx`:

``` sh
npx djockey docs
```

Or grab a binary from the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/releases).

In order to use Markdown, you must also [install
Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
