# Building and running Djot locally

## Using [Bun](https://bun.sh) (preferred)

It’s best to iterate on Djockey with <span id="indexterm-2"
indexterm="Bun" id="indexterm-2">Bun</span> because you don’t need to
compile the TypeScript and it boots instantly.

Assuming you’ve already installed `bun`, `bun install` and `bun test`
work as usual.

`Makefile` has a few shortcuts for working this way. Run `make docs` to
build the documentation for local browsing using <span id="indexterm-7"
indexterm="Bun" id="indexterm-7">Bun</span>; this is effectively the
best integration test for Djockey right now.

## Using Node

Djockey supports Node because most potential users already have Node
installed.

You can use `yarn djockey` to build Djockey with `tsc` and run Djockey
using Node. `yarn test` and `yarn test:watch` will run the tests using
[Jest](https://jestjs.io).
