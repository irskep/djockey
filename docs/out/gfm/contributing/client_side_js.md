# Client-side JS

Djockeyâ€™s built-in client-side JavaScript is written in Typescript under
`src/clientjs/index.ts` and compiled with `bun build --target=browser`.
The built JS is committed to git as `templates/html/static/client.js`,
in order to avoid <span id="indexterm-0" indexterm="Bun"
id="indexterm-0">Bun</span> as a hard dependency for using Djockey.
