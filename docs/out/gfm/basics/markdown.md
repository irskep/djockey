# Using Markdown

You can use all standard features of Markdown with Djockey. If you find
you can't, [file a bug](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues).

Link resolution, syntax highlighting, and Mermaid diagrams work the same
way as with Djot.

GitHub's markdown is too limited to access most of Djockey's unique
features. [In the future](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues/12)
you will be able to choose a different Markdown variant.
