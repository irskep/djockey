# Linking

Everything you can do in Markdown, you can also do in Djockey. If you
find that you can’t, it’s a bug and [you should report
it](https://github.com/irskep/djockey/issues/new). But Djockey tries to
make your life easier by letting you be less specific with your links,
as long as they are unambiguous.

## Extension or no extension, up to you

If you have a doc at `life.dj`, you can link to it with either
`[link text](life.dj)` or just `[link text](life)`.

<div id="Static-files" class="section" id="Static-files">

## Static files

You can link to static files using relative paths, or absolute paths
where the root is `input_dir`.

## Shorthand link resolution

Let’s say you wrote some text you need to refer to in many places across
your docs, and gave it a custom identifier:

``` djot
{% in /reference/answers/big-questions/life.dj %}
{#the-answer}
# The answer to life, the universe, and everything

It's 42.
```

In any other documentation system, you’d need to link to
`/reference/answers/big-questions/life#the-answer`, or use a relative
URL like `../../answers/big-questions/life#the-answer`. But if you move
`life.dj` to another directory, you need to find all those links and
update them.

With Djockey, you can link to it anywhere with just `#the-answer`, and
Djockey will figure out which doc it lives in. If there are two files
containing a heading `#the-answer`, you can use just enough of the path
to disambiguate the two, like `life#the-answer` or
`answers/big-questions/life.dj#the-answer`.

The goal of this feature is to make it easier to reorganize your docs on
the fly. If there’s any ambiguity, Djockey will warn you at build time.

Shorthand link resolution doesn’t work for static files, but in theory
it could be made to.
