## Overriding HTML tags

Djot does not ([yet](https://github.com/jgm/djot/issues/240)) support
arbitrary HTML tags in its input or output. Djockey works around this by
postprocessing Djot’s HTML output. Whenever you add a `tag=foo`
attribute, Djockey will replace the element’s tag with the attribute’s
value.

Input:

``` djot
{tag=details}
:::
[I'm from Mattel!]{tag=summary}
Well, I'm not really from Mattel. I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
:::
```

Output:

<div tag="details">

<span tag="summary">I’m from Mattel!</span> Well, I’m not really from
Mattel. I’m actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a
leveraged buyout.

</div>
