# Sections

Djockey uses the directory tree to group documents into sections and
subsections.

<div id="index-dj" class="section" id="index-dj">

## `index.dj`

Put an `index.dj` (or `index.md`) file in any directory to customize its
metadata (`title`, `order`) and give the beginning of the section some
content.

If `index.dj` contains front matter but no content, then the section
will use the front matter, but no page will be rendered. As an example,
see the “Plugins” vs “Writing with Djockey” sections on this site.
