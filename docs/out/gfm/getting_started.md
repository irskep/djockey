# Getting Started

Once you’ve [installed Djockey](./installation.md#Installation), create
a file called `djockey.yaml` that looks like this:

``` yaml
input_dir: path-to-your-docs
output_dir:
  html: docs_out/html
  gfm: docs_out/gfm
site_name: "Your Name Here"
url_root: https://where-docs-will-be-deployed

html:
  footer_text: "©2024 You"
```

Now try running `npx djockey --local`. Maybe it’ll just work! If not, it
should tell you what’s wrong.

<div id="Building-for-local-viewing-vs-deployment" class="section"

## Building for local viewing vs deployment

When your site is generated, all internal URLs are prefixed with the
value of `urlRoot`, which is counterproductive if you want to view your
site without a web server and some edits to `/etc/hosts`.

To have Djockey use file URLs instead, only valid on your own machine
and not requiring a web server, pass `--local`.

``` sh
djockey my_docs_dir --local
```

</div>
